# Data-Compression-Using-Huffman-Encoding-with-C
# Data-Compression-Using-Huffman-Algorithm (Python).


1. This is my first Project which i had done for my 3rd Sem Miniproject in BE.
2. This shows only Encoding of text using Huffman trees.
3. Just a Simple and fundemental project which helped me to gain knowledge of Trees.
4. If you are interested you can try implementing Decoding part in C.
5. I have done full End-to-End Compression using Python for practise you can find it in the code Section.
